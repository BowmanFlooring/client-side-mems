# NOTE

- ALL actions that are going to be done towards our backend
are going to be done using Redux. We need to dispatch
those actions. To do that, we need to write in some boiler-
plate code; meaning - we do have to manually add some files
and folders with a certain structure. Later on down this app's
journey, that boilerplate code will be great, simply for the
effect of it's SCALABILITY, if nothing else.

- Now, to implement Redux, it does take quite a lot of additional
files and folders. But it's worth it in the long run
